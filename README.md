# Hi, I'm Martha Rodríguez Malagón 👋
## Data Analyst | Registered Nurse

### About Me
Data Analyst Junior with a healthcare background and hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and Tableau. My interest in data analytics comes from my experience as an ICU nurse, where data-driven decision-making is critical.

During my training, I worked on projects involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and dashboard development. I enjoy transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that support better decision-making.

I am recognized for my critical thinking, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, developed in high-pressure clinical environments and applied to analytical projects. I am especially interested in healthcare analytics, healthtech, and data-driven products.
